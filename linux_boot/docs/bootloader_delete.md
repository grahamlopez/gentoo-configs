# Bootloader Delete - EFI stub boot

The linux kernel can be booted directly from (U)EFI firmware by emulating a
(FIXME: PK?) binary and being placed in an agreed-upon place where the firmware
can find it.

## linux kernel configuration

## EFI firmware configuration

efibootmgr, lsblk, blkid, etc.
