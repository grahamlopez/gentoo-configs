I would like to optimize my kernel build for this machine with the following goals in mind in order of priority:
- system stability
- complete functionality provided by the hardware
- virtualization (host) support
- system performance (power-optimized and speed)
- size and boot speed: as little extra code enabled as possible, while supporting the other priorities
- administration simplicity

Let's make a plan about how to move my kernel configuration and installation to support the above goals. I would like it to go step by step, and I would like short justifications for all of the changes we make (e.g. kernel options disabled) so that I have a reference.

You can find information about various aspects of my system in the files uploaded in this Space, including hardware information and how I currently build my kernel.
